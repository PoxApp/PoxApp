    "data_privacy_content": "<strong>Data protection information pursuant to Article 13 GDPR</strong>\n(Version: 08 July 2020)\n\n<strong>1. Controller</strong>\n\nThe Controller of the processing of personal data when using the CovApp is \n\nRobert Koch-Institute (RKI)\nNordufer 20\n13353 Berlin \n\nPhone: <a href=\"tel:0049301875400\">030 18754 0 - 0</a>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:info@rki.de\">info@rki.de</a>\n\nAs long as the data are processed exclusively on the user's terminal device with the help of the installed software, the users themselves shall be the Controllers.\n\n<strong>2. Data Protection Officer</strong>\n\nYou can contact the RKI data protection officer at our postal address (see item 1) addressing your communication: \"To the data protection officer\" as well as by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:datenschutz@rki.de\">datenschutz(at)rki.de</a>.\n\n<strong>3. What personal data are processed, for what purposes and on what legal basis?</strong>\n\nThe CovApp is a web application. The CovApp is intended to support you in assessing whether you need further investigation regarding a potential Covid 19 infection. The CovApp’s aim is to guide you safely through the various healthcare services and, where necessary, to show you the way to hospitals or examination centers. A directly personalised login or registration is not necessary.\n\n<strong>Please be expressly informed that this offer does not replace medical advice or treatment.</strong>\n\n<strong> a) Visiting the Website</strong>\n\nThe RKI is supported in the operation and further development of CovApp by D4L data4life gGmbH, Charlottenstraße 109, 14467 Potsdam, Germany as Processor within the meaning of Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). D4L data4life gGmbH provides the server for the website.\n\nWhen accessing the website, the following data (metadata) are automatically transferred to the web server of D4L data4life gGmbH:\n\n- IP address of the device used for accessing the website\n- Web address (URL) of the page from which the data was requested (referrer)\n- Date and time of the request\n- Amount of data transmitted\n- Description of the type of web browser used.\n\nThe processing of these browser data, which does not contain the actual name of the user, but still contains a (pseudonymised) personal reference via the IP address, is technically necessary to display the website and to guarantee the website’s stability and security. The IP address is stored for a maximum period of seven days to prevent misuse of the web application and/or cyber-attacks on the servers of our Processor, D4L data4life gGmbH in Germany, and is deleted after such period. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(e) GDPR in conjunction with § 3 of the German Data Protection Act (BDSG). \n\n\n<strong> b) Completing the questionnaire and creating a QR code</strong>\n\nThe CovApp contains questions about current symptoms, your recent trips and possible contacts you may have had. The answers you give to the questions and the recommendations for action displayed automatically based on your answers are <u>processed exclusively locally on the end-device you use (smartphone, tablet or PC)</u>; there is no data exchange with the server at this stage of using the CovApp. The answers you enter are stored separately and on your device.\n\nAfter completing the questionnaire, the answers you have given and the resulting recommendations for action can be summarised in a QR Code. This operation is also exclusively carried out locally on your end-device. The QR code generated only contains encrypted answers of the user, so that outsiders cannot see the questions or the answers given. Only at a later point in time, for example when you visit a doctor, will you be able to show the QR code stored locally on your device and give the information contained therein, for example, to your doctor. This makes it easier to record the necessary anamnesis data and noticeably reduces the burden on medical care.\n\nThe legal basis for the disclosure of your personal health data in these cases is Article 9(2)(i) GDPR in conjunction with § 22(1)(c) BDSG or, in the event of your express consent – which can be withdrawn at any time – Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) GDPR.\n\nYou can delete the data stored by CovApp on your terminal device at any time by clicking “Delete answers” at the end of the questionnaire.\n\n<strong> c) Survey of the postal code (ZIP code) of the place of stay and transmission of data to the Charité University Hospital Berlin together with the risk classification</strong>\n\nAt the end of your survey, you will have the opportunity to voluntarily consent to the transmission of the postal code of your place of stay. This information will be sent to the Charité University Hospital Berlin together with the risk classification resulting from the answers to the questions, but without the answers from the questionnaire. This will allow us to draw valuable conclusions on the further spread of the pandemic. The legal basis for the transmission of this data is your voluntary and informed consent under Articles 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) GDPR. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. In such case, the lawfulness of the processing of your data until revocation shall remain unaffected.\n\nThe information – postcode and risk classification without a link to the IP address – processed by RKI is not personal, but anonymous. Depending on the development of the pandemic’s spread, the Charité University Hospital Berlin may make the data thus transmitted available to third parties to better manage containment measures against the Covid 19 pandemic.\n\n<strong> d) Possible analysis of user behaviour and error analysis</strong>\n\nYou can voluntarily consent to the analysis of your user behaviour and the troubleshooting analysis which serves to improve the service. To this end, a cookie banner will appear upon accessing the website, which will ask for your voluntary consent (linked to your IP address). Your answers to the questions are irrelevant here. Specifically, this consent concerns the analysis of user data for scientific purposes (as explained under aa below), and for the improvement of the CovApp, e.g. how often the possibility of creating and using the QR Code has been used. Your data will be anonymised before use. The legal basis is your voluntary and informed consent, pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, to the collection and anonymisation of your personal data for use in the respective analysis. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. In such case, the lawfulness of the processing of your data until revocation shall remain unaffected. Your consent includes the following:\n\naa) Analysis of user data for scientific purposes and for the optimisation of the application\n\nThe anonymised data obtained from the analysis of your use of the CovApp supports the RKI, among other things, in identifying clusters by evaluating periods of time, risk factors and locations thereof. Furthermore, by determining at which point the answering of the questions is frequently interrupted, we can optimise the questionnaire. This analysis enables us to draw valuable conclusions for pandemic control. It is not possible for us to draw any conclusions about you personally based on the data collected for the usage analysis.\n\nThis analysis is carried out with the help of “Matomo”, a free web analysis software, which does not transfer any data to third parties. The following data are collected via Matomo and processed anonymously for the usage analysis: \n\n- IP address; \n- Date and time of the request; \n- Titles of viewed URLs, URLs of viewed web pages, URLs of previous web pages (only within the app); \n- Screen resolution, time in your time zone, time to load the website; \n- Geoinformation: country, region, city, language of the browser, user agent of the browser and \n- Events: click on \"Start questionnaire\", click on \"Resume questionnaire\", click on \"Next question\" for all questions, click on \"go back (to previous question)\" for all questions, click on \"Show previous QR code\", click on \"Print QR code\", click on \"Delete QR code\", click on \"your answers\", event \"questionnaire was completed\", event \"questionnaire was aborted\". All other events, especially events that could allow conclusions to be drawn about answers provided in the questionnaire, are not recorded and transmitted. \n \nbb) Troubleshooting analysis\n\nFor the analysis of possible errors of CovApp we use “Sentry”, a tool that does not disclose data to third parties. The following data are collected for troubleshooting purposes:\n\n- Technical data, such as information about the device and browser you are using and \n- the time of a possible error or crash of the system.\n\nThe above mentioned data are only used to detect the respective error or crash and to correct such problems. It is not possible for us to draw conclusions about you personally based on the data collected for troubleshooting purposes.\n\n<strong>4. No obligation to provide personal data</strong>\n\nWhile using CovApp, you are not obliged to provide any personal data beyond the above mentioned information. You can use CovApp to its full extent without giving your consent to our analysis on the use of the app.\n\n<strong>5. Recipients / categories of recipients of personal data</strong>\n\nWhile using CovApp, personal health data will only be disclosed if the QR code is decrypted as described in 3.b).\n\n<strong>6. Duration of storage / deletion</strong>\n\nYour IP address will be stored for a maximum period of seven days to prevent misuse of the web application and/or cyber-attacks on the servers of our Processor, D4L data4life gGmbH in Germany, and will be deleted after such period. The storage of the postal code associated with the risk assessment is also carried out anonymously without reference to a specific person.\n\n<strong>7. No automated decision-making including profiling</strong>\n\nIn the context of the use and possible analysis of CovApp, no decision will be made solely on the basis of automated processing – including profiling – that may have a legal effect on you or significantly affect you in a similar way.\n\n<strong>8. Your rights</strong>\n\nYou have the following rights with regard to the personal data concerning you:\n\n- Right of access (Article 15 GDPR), \n- Right to rectification (Article 16 GDPR), \n- Right to erasure (Article 17 GDPR; \"right to be forgotten\"), \n- Right to restriction of processing (Article 18 GDPR), \n- Right to object to the processing (Article 21 DPA), \n- Right to data portability (Article 20 GDPR).\n\nYou also have the right to file complaints to the RKI's data protection officer and to the supervisory authority responsible for the RKI (Der Bundesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit (BfDI), Graurheindorfer Str. 153 - 53117 Bonn, +49 (0)228-997799-0) about the processing of your personal data by us if you believe that the processing of personal data concerning you is unlawful.",
