    "data_privacy_content": "<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>\n(Status: April 2, 2020)\n\n<strong>1. Controller</strong>\n\nThe provider of the Website and controller of the processing of your personal data relevant to the use of the CovApp is Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Charitéplatz 1, 10117 Berlin.\n\nAs long as the data is processed exclusively on the user's device with the help of the installed software, the users themselves are controller.\n\n<strong>2. Data protection officer</strong>\n\nYou can contact our Data Protection Officer via email <a href=\"mailto:datenschutz@charite.de\">datenschutz(at)charite.de</a> or our postal address with the addition “Der/Die Datenschutzbeauftragte” (German for “Data Protection Officer”).\n\n<strong>3. Which data is processed for which purposes and on which legal basis?</strong>\n\n<strong> a) Visiting the website</strong>\n\nThe CovApp is a web application. When the web page is called, the following data is automatically transferred to the web server of the Charité:\n\n- IP address of the device used for the retrieval\n- Web address (URL) of the page from which the file was requested (referrer)\n- Date and time of the request\n- Amount of data transmitted\n- Description of the type of web browser used.\n\nThe processing of this browser data, which does not show a clear name of the user, but which nevertheless contains a (pseudonymized) personal reference via the IP address, is technically necessary and is carried out in our legitimate interest in showing you our website and in ensuring the stability and security of the website. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The above-mentioned data will not be stored for a longer period of time after use of the app.\n\n<strong> b) Filling out the questionnaire and creating a QR code</strong>\n\nThe CovApp should help you to assess whether there is a need for further clarification regarding the COVID-19 disease. This offer does not replace medical advice or treatment. No directly personalized application or registration necessary to use the CovApp. \n\nThe CovApp contains questions about current symptoms, your recent trips and possible interactions. The answers you give to the questions and the automatically displayed recommendations for action depending on your answers are processed exclusively locally on the device you use (smartphone, tablet, or PC); at this stage no data is transmitted to the server. Your answers to the questionnaire are stored locally and protected on your device only.\n\nIt is possible to summarize the answers and further information you have provided in a QR code after the questionnaire has been completed. This is also done purely locally and without data exchange with the Charité. At a later point in time, for example when you visit Charité for an appointment or take advantage of the offer of a video consultation hour, it is possible for you to show the QR code stored locally on your device and to transmit the information contained therein. This makes it easier to collect the necessary medical data and noticeably relieves the medical care. \n\nThe legal basis for the disclosure of your health-related data in these cases is Art. 9 para. 2 lit. i GDPR in conjunction with § 22 para. 1 No. c BDSG or, in the case of your expressed consent - which can be revoked at any time - Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR. If a hospital treatment contract is concluded, the legal basis is Section 24 of the Berlin State Hospital Act. From the time of disclosure – and subsequent data processing in the Charité hospital information system – the data protection information provided by the Charité apply.\n\nYou can delete the data stored by CovApp on your device at any time by clicking \"Delete answers\" at the end of the questionnaire.  \n\n<strong> c) Possible analysis of user behavior and error analysis</strong>\n\nYou can voluntarily agree to the analysis of your user behaviour and the error analysis serving to improve the offer. For this purpose, a cookie banner is displayed at the beginning of the visit to the website, which asks for your voluntary consent (linked to your IP address). Sensitive answers to the questions are not recorded for the analysis. The analysis is focused on the evaluation of user data for scientific purposes and to improve the CovApp, i.e. how often the possibility of creating and using the QR code is used. Your data will be anonymized before use. The legal basis for this is your voluntary and informed consent under Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR to the collection and anonymization of your personal data for use in the relevant analysis. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. The legality of the processing of your data until revocation remains unaffected. Your consent includes the following:\n\naa) Analysis of user data for scientific purposes and to optimize the application\n\nThe anonymized data obtained from the analysis of your use of the CovApp helps Charité to identify “hot spots” by evaluating time periods, risk factors and whereabouts, among other things. By determining at which point the answering of the questions is frequently interrupted, we can optimize the questionnaire.\n\nThis analysis allows valuable conclusions to be drawn for pandemic control. It is not possible for us to draw any conclusions about your person on the basis of the data collected for usage analysis.\n\nThe analysis is carried out with the help of \"Matomo\", a free web analysis software that does not transfer any data to third parties. The following data is collected by Matomo and processed anonymously for the usage analysis:\n\n- IP address\n- Date and time of the request\n- Title of the URLs viewed, URLs of the web pages viewed, URLs of previous web pages (only within the app) \n- Screen resolution, time in your own time zone, time to load the website\n- Geoinformation: country, region, city, browser language, browser user agent \n- Events: click on \"Start questionnaire\", click on \"Resume questionnaire\", click on \"Next question\" for all questions, click on \"go back (to previous question)\" for all questions, click on \"Show previous QR code\", click on \"Print QR code\", click on \"Delete QR code\", click on \"your answers\", event \"questionnaire was completed\", event \"questionnaire was aborted\", click on \"Continue to the Data4Life app\", click on \"Send answers to the Data4Life app\". All other events, especially events that could allow conclusions to be drawn about given answers in the questionnaire, are not recorded and transmitted. \n\nbb) Analysis for error correction\n\nFor the analysis of possible errors of the CovApp we use \"Sentry\", a tool which we also use without the possibility of disclosing data to third parties. The following information is collected for troubleshooting purposes:\n\n- Technical data, such as information about the device and browser you are using and \n- The time of a possible error or crash of the system. \n\nThe above-mentioned data is only used to get information about the respective error or crash and to solve such problems. It is not possible for us to draw any conclusions about your person on the basis of the data collected for troubleshooting purposes.\n\n<strong>d) Collection of the postal code (ZIP code) of the place of residence and transmission to Charité in combination with the \"traffic light color”</strong>\n\nAs part of the further development of the CovApp, it is planned to ask you for the postal code of your place of residence at the end of your survey. This information will be transmitted to Charité together with the risk classification resulting from the answers to the questions. This will enable us to draw valuable conclusions for the further spatial spread of the pandemic. The legal basis for the transmission of this date, is your voluntary and informed consent in accordance with Art. 9 (2) lit. a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. The lawfulness of the processing of your data until revocation remains unaffected.\n\nFor the Charité the information – postal code and risk classification without linking to the IP address – is not personal. The information is therefore anonymous. Depending on the development of the situation, it is conceivable that the Charité will make the data thus transmitted available to third parties for the further fight against the pandemic.\n\n<strong>4. No obligation to provide personal data</strong>\n\nYou are not obliged to provide personal data beyond the above-mentioned information when using the CovApp. You may use the CovApp to its full extent without giving your consent to analyze the use of the app.\n\n<strong>5. Recipients/categories of recipients of personal data</strong>\n\nAs part of the use of the CovApp, health-related data about you will be disclosed if you allow the QR code to be read on-site at the hospital. Apart from this, no special categories of personal data are disclosed. Charité is responsible for the processing of personal data.\n\n<strong>6. Duration of storage/deletion</strong>\n\nYour IP address is automatically anonymized at the end of your session in the CovApp. Thereafter – if you have agreed – only data collected for the purposes of pandemic control, scientific purposes and to improve the app will be processed anonymously.\n\n<strong>7. No automated decision-making including profiling</strong>\n\nIn the context of the use and possible analysis of the CovApp, no decision is made solely on the basis of automated decision-making – including profiling – that has legal effect on you or that significantly affects you in a similar way.\n\n<strong>8. Your rights</strong>\n\nIn accordance with the GDPR, you have the following rights with regard to your personal data to the extent permitted by law:\n\n- Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR) \n- Right to rectification (Article 16 GDPR)\n- Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR; \"right to be forgotten\")\n- Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR) \n- Right to object to processing (Art. 21 GDPR)\n- Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)\n\nYou also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority about the processing of your personal data if you believe that the processing of personal data concerning you is unlawful.",
    "q_X1_comment": "In order to draw valuable conclusions about the further expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, we ask for your consent to transmit your postal code and your recommendation to Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. The data will be stored in an anonymous form (postal code and recommendation) and if necessary, the data will be shared with third parties as part of the fight against pandemics. You can revoke your consent at any time. The revocation does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before the revocation.\n\nIf you would like to give your consent to the transmission of the postal code and the recommendation of your recommended action, choose “Yes” below. You will then be asked for your postal code in the next step.\n\nTo continue without submitting your data, choose “No” below.

    "faq_content": "<strong>About the coronavirus</strong>\nThe scientific term for the novel coronavirus is „SARS-CoV-2“. This virus can cause a respiratory disease. The name of this disease is called „COVID-19“. Because the infectious disease COVID-19 has already spread across countries and continents, it's referred to as a pandemic.\n\n<strong>Transmission</strong>\nThe new coronavirus is transmitted via droplet infection. It can directly be transferred between humans, when droplets containing the virus get into the respiratory system after they are absorbed via the lining of the mouth and nose or via the conjunctiva of the eye. But an indirect infection is also possible, when droplets are transmitted via the hands to the mucosa of mouth, nose and eyes. Symptoms occur 5 to 6, at most 14 days, after infection.\n\n<strong>Symptoms</strong>\nAfter an infection with the coronavirus, the disease runs a mild course and is not life-threatening for most people. This extends to pregnant women and children. There can be flu-like symptoms, such as a dry cough, fatigue and fever. Furthermore, some patients suffer from a sore throat, headaches, limb pain and chills. Currently it’s been assumed that 4 in 5 cases run a mild course. Though in some patients the infection can have a serious course, causing respiratory distress and bilateral pneumonia. This mostly affects elderly persons or people with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer. Those severe cases have to be treated in intensive care in a hospital.\n\n<strong>Solidarity</strong>\nAlthough there is a very good healthcare system available in Germany, it is not prepared for a rapid increase in intensive care patients. But if it is possible to prolong an increase in severe cases, treatment of infected patients will continue to be available. This can only be done if every citizen practices social distancing. As a precautionary measure, especially for the elderly generation and the chronically ill, everyone should take the situation seriously and avoid social contact as much as possible. But please, provide for elderly and chronically ill relatives or neighbors and living alone or persons in need with food and daily life essentials. Be considerate and attentive for their needs and worries. Communicate with each other – but stay at least 1.5 meters apart. Act in solidarity.\n\n<strong>Protection</strong>\nTo slow down the spreading of the virus, avoid direct contact, for example when meeting someone. Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly, at least 20 seconds with soap and water. Keep as much distance as possible when coughing or sneezing – turn away from other people. Sneeze into a sleeve or a tissue, which you throw into a bin immediately. Don’t share something you touched with your mouth, like a glass or a bottle, with someone else. Stay at home.\n\n<strong>Therapy</strong>\nThe therapy of the infection depends on the severity of the disease. Mild cases don’t have to be treated and can get well at home. Severe pneumonia has to be treated, for example with oxygen treatment, fluid substitution or antibiotics to treat bacterial co-infections. This mostly has to be done in a hospital.\n\n<strong>Vaccination</strong>\nIn the meanwhile, there is availability for vaccines from multiple vendors which all demonstrated a high efficacy to prevent a severe courses of COVID-19. For an individualized recommendation and carrying out the vaccination, please seek for medical advice.\n\n<strong>Get help</strong>\nViolence against women support Hotline: <a href=\"tel:+4980000116016\">08000 116 016</a>\nCrisis Hotline: <a href=\"tel:+498001110111\">0800 111 0 111</a> or <a href=\"tel:+498001110222\">0800 111 0 222</a>\n\n<strong>Stay informed</strong>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus.html\" target=\"_blank\">German Ministry of Health</a> regularly updates the information on the coronavirus.\n\nCharité researcher Prof. Dr. Christian Drosten keeps you up-to-date on the <a href=\"https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/Corona-Podcast-Alle-Folgen-in-der-Uebersicht,podcastcoronavirus134.html\" target=\"_blank\">NDR podcast</a>",
