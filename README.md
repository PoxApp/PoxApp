# 😷 PoxApp - a web-based personalized recommendation system for the monkeypox virus

PoxApp can help users to assess their medical condition better, provide recommendations regarding doctor’s visits or MPXV testing by answering a few questions. 

Additionally, every filled out questionnaire summarizes relevant medical information for future doctor’s consultation in the form of a summary page, printout or a QR code. Institutions with the technical setup can scan the provided QR code and retrieve the patient information quickly and without any physical contact.

By implementing the PoxApp, medical institution can speed up the patient registration process.
