# PoxApp Frontend

> :stethoscope: :iphone: A personalized recommendation and data collection system for monkeypox.

PoxApp can help users to assess their medical condition better, provide recommendations regarding doctorâ€™s visits or monkeypox testing by answering a few questions. PoxApp has an anonymous and voluntary data donation which can be used to collect data for machine learning models to detect outbreaks and predict future case numbers.

Additionally, PoxApp can be used to prepare a doctor's consolutation. Every filled out survey summarizes relevant medical information in the form of a summary page, printout or a QR code. Institutions with the technical setup can scan the provided QR code and retrieve the patient information quickly and without any physical contact.

By implementing PoxApp, any medical institution can reduce the number of new incoming patients, avoid physical contact and speed up the patient registration process.
